                <br class="text_white">
                <span class="text_white">I was a born a Navy brat (Rota,
                  Spain 1968), my dad a Chief Petty Officer and
                  cryptographer in the Naval Security Group. I guess
                  being born near the ocean put salt in my blood because
                  no matter where I live (New Jersey and eastern Penn,
                  the frigid cold of Maine and high heat of the AZ
                  desert, the mountains of West Virginia, the Crystal
                  Coast of North Carolina, and the Rust Belt in eastern
                  Ohio) I am always happiest near the water, where the
                  constant renewal and spiritual power of the ocean
                  remind me (both while awake and in my dreams) that
                  awesome beauty and horrific destruction come from the
                  same source (we moved from NC just in time to miss
                  Hurricane Florence in 2018), depending on the
                  convergence of natural events and the Universal
                  mindset.&#8232;&#8232;</span></p>
              <p> I got heavily involved in the performing and literary
                arts in high school, participating in chorus, theatre,
                music and writing and entering state and national arts
                competitions. In ‘86 I got accepted to Beaver College
                (now Arcadia University) and while there had a blast,
                got good grades, appeared in 10 theatre productions and
                became the first undergraduate to direct the fully
                funded Spring production. I returned for years for the
                annual networking luncheon with graduating seniors,
                where I could share the good news that it is possible to
                make a decent living in the arts. In 2006 I did a
                reading and a Master’s class in creative writing as part
                of their “Writers Return to Campus” series.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> I spent two years after college painting houses and
                doing construction laborer work before heading up a
                Feasibility Study for a proposed performing arts center
                in Manasquan, NJ (31 years later, they are still going
                strong). I spent a year visiting a dozen theatres in
                Jersey, meeting with staff and writing research reports
                on fundraising, education and other aspects of theatre
                administration. Once they moved to the next phase I
                moved on and spent several years working in database
                publishing, while acting, directing and teaching at
                night and on weekends. I tried graduate school and hated
                the lazy chumminess of it, so I quit after a semester,
                spending the money I would have spent on school building
                a large literary and video/DVD library of all things of
                interest to me, which is just about everything in one
                way or another, but especially comparative religion,
                mythology, history, and the nature of God, Lucifer, and
                their relationship to Humankind.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> In 1997 I had a series of life-altering experiences
                that grabbed a good hunk of my faith and energy so I
                went out to Arizona to wander the desert for six weeks,
                beating up on cactus and writing hundreds of poems to
                try and regain some lost balance and perspective. It
                ultimately worked, although one night I did “poise a pen
                on the edge of death” as recorded in one of those
                hundreds of poems. I took a job as the managing director
                of a 120-seat black box theatre in AZ (also still going
                strong, although my two close friends and mentors who
                founded it have since gone on to that Great White Way in
                the Sky) and continued to act and direct. I also found
                Tonya out there, whom I met, courted, moved in with, and
                married in the whirlwind span of 9 months. She has been
                my Muse, critic, lover, collaborator, and friend for 26
                years now, and we have three children: Daniel, Jeremy
                and Jolie. In order to spend more time with them I
                started freelance copyediting academic journals and
                textbooks, and I still do that when I am not writing or
                otherwise creating.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> I never saw myself as a teacher behind a desk, but
                have always loved working with kids. I have the best of
                both worlds in being an acting and creative writing
                teacher. Not only do I teach traditional theatre
                techniques to serious young actors, I have developed a
                curriculum based on my philosophy that the greatest
                value in studying theatre comes not in learning how to
                act, but in critical thinking, team and confidence
                building, creative projects, and problem solving, all of
                which can be taught using theatre.</p>
              <p> My creative writing teaching includes mentorships with
                promising young writers in high schools and colleges
                across the country, as well as workshops at various
                conferences.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> In the early 2000s I spent a great deal of time
                teaching theatre and creative writing and touring in 3
                plays for a youth theatre and education company called
                Youth Stages, 2 of which I wrote. I wrote another 2
                plays for them in my capacity as Resident Playwright.
                They closed their doors several years ago when the
                founder retired, but several of the plays are being
                produced elsewhere. I also did outreach and teaching
                artist work for public schools, recreation centers, and
                libraries.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> I have appeared in, directed, and/or written well over
                100 plays and a dozen projects on camera, including
                acting in the 2014 remake of White Zombie and my first
                film as writer/director received an Honorable Mention at
                the 2016 Indie Gathering International Film Festival
                (Cleveland, OH). After 19 years, we recently closed the
                theatre company I cofounded and served as the Artistic
                Director of. Along the way we had productions in several
                states, won some awards, and reached tens of thousands
                of young people with my bullying education programs and
                social justice plays.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> As far as my life as a writer, my screenplay&nbsp;<i>The


                  Man at the Foot of the Bed</i>&nbsp;(based on a true
                story by Josette Saginario) has been a two-time Official
                Selection, a Beverly Hills Film Festival invitee, and a
                two-time quarterfinalist. My screenplay&nbsp;<i>Seven
                  Dates in Seven Nights</i>&nbsp;was a quarterfinalist
                in the Screencraft Comedy Contest. I have several more
                screenplays currently being shopped by producers. I have
                written several main stage musicals and dramas, with a
                specialty in Historical Education Theatre and
                participatory plays for youth. I have written and
                performed pieces about Civil War Captain Louis Emilio as
                a Chautauqua Scholar for Voices from the Earth, which
                does symposia and performances on the African American
                experience in the Civil War and I portrayed for two
                years six different Golden Age pirates in “Blackbeard
                and the Pirates of Carolina,” which was commissioned by
                Port City Tour Co. (In 2017 it was featured on “Passage
                of Dreams,” a Japanese television show sponsored by
                Tokyo Disney). I still tour as the pirates and have
                written four novels about them (the Cannon and the Quill
                series). I am currently writing the fifth. </p>
              <p> In June 2019 I toured as Ernesto “Che” Guevara for
                Oklahoma Chautauqua and returned there in 2022 as Allen
                Ginsberg. I also portray the pirate Samuel Bellamy for
                organizations around the country and did a video
                performance as Mariano Vallejo during the COVID years.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
              <p> My poetry has been widely published and I have had
                several plays for young audiences published and had
                another win an award and a staged reading. My plays have
                now been produced in 17 states and several countries. I
                have been publishing essays and short stories, and I
                have written 13 books. New Mystics Enterprises published
                my fantasy novel,&nbsp;<i>Jester-Knight</i>, in early
                2009. The sequel, <i>Aldemere’s Dilemma</i>, will be
                published in February 2024, and the first book will
                feature a new cover for the fifteenth anniversary.</p>
