              About thirty-seven years ago I was visiting Sant Darshan
              Singh (1921–1989), one of the greatest poet-saints of
              modern India. Sant Darshan Singh could fly into poetic
              verse at the drop of a hat and he was adored by millions
              of his poetry fans and hundreds of thousands of his
              disciples. By what appeared to be sheer chance, Sant
              Darshan Singh asked me and my brother Andrew if we would
              take a collection of poems by Tayumanavar, and several
              other ancient poets of India, and get them published for
              the American public. Of course, we were deeply honored by
              this request but had no clue as to why he would ask us to
              carry out this task.&nbsp; Nothing in our past lives
              seemed to qualify us for Sant Darshan Singh’s unbounded
              grace.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              When I returned to America, I diligently prepared the
              poetry for publication.&nbsp; As luck would have it, my
              house burned down and the result was that virtually all of
              my worldly items – including Tayumanavar’s poetry -
              disappeared. As luck changes, sometimes what appears to be
              a moment of sadness can carry a silver lining. A dear
              friend died several months ago and after the funeral her
              husband decided to give me some literature that he found
              in his home. I accepted the literature in the spirit of
              being helpful to a husband in grief but with no thought
              that it would be of value. After several days, I decided
              to look through the documents and, to my surprise, there
              was a copy of the original poems by Tayumanavar.&nbsp; The
              death of my dear friend had released Tayumanavar’s poetry
              from the fires to rise like the phoenix – almost as if
              Sant Darshan Singh had re-materialized the poems out of
              thin air.<br>
              <br>
              What makes this story meaningful to me is that
              Tayumanavar’s life was a virtual carbon copy of that of
              Sant Darshan Singh.&nbsp; Both were poet-saints, both
              followed the householder path founded on the belief that
              spiritual seekers should live in the world but not be of
              it.&nbsp; Similarly Tayumanavar was a well-educated
              government worker who mastered Sanskrit and the language
              of Tamil Nadu – the Indian province in which he
              lived.&nbsp; Similarly, Sant Darshan Singh was a very high
              ranking government official who spoke multiple languages
              including English, Urdu and Hindi. <br>
              <br>
              These were not the only parallel features of their lives.
              Tayumanavar was a prolific poet who wrote “with simplicity
              and sweetness.” Thomas Manninezhath called him “the prince
              among Tamil mystical poets and the psalm singer of
              Hinduism.” His gift was his ability to heal the divisive
              tendencies of various Hindu sects of seventeenth century
              Tamil Nadu.&nbsp; It is not surprising that Sant Darshan
              Singh found much to admire in Tayumanavar since he also
              espoused the fatherhood of God (or what some today may
              call the motherhood of God) and the brotherhood/sisterhood
              of every embodied soul on the planet.&nbsp; Tayumanavar
              wrote over 1,400 devotional hymns that have been saved for
              posterity. Like Sant Darshan Singh’s poetry—which is
              extremely lyrical and devotional—Tayumanavar’s poetry was
              created to be sung in devotion.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              What is important to remember is that the five poems of
              Tayumanavar that are presented here were selected by a God
              realized being who intuitively knew what poems would be
              best for the American audience. Why these five poems have
              finally seen the light in your eyes is purely a gift of
              God and a reminder that not all thing are in the hands of
              man.<br>
