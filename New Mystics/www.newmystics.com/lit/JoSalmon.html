      <span class="text_white"></span><span class="text_white">I
write because no-one seems to listen to me when I speak.&nbsp; Little
girls should be seen and not heard and it is not ladylike to
shout.&nbsp; So I write everything down. And I mean EVERYTHING, all my
thoughts, plans, feelings, lists, menus, budgets and timetables.&nbsp;
I try to be as descriptive and as honest and creative as&nbsp;I can,
and now and again there are what&nbsp;I call my 'diamonds in the
dust'.&nbsp; My journal, my journey is my goal.&nbsp; I write because I
can.&nbsp; I am lucky to have that freedom now.&nbsp; It hasn't always
been so.&nbsp; I was for 7 years trapped in an Orwellian nightmare of a
marriage where I had to justify and therefore be aware of every word I
spoke and every tone of voice, every facial expression so I dared not
write anything down in case it could be used in evidence against
me.&nbsp; When that marriage was over, I searched through the attic for
my previous life.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all gone.&nbsp; There were no
photographs of me as a child, no old birthday cards from my auntie Vi
and, worst of all, all the writing I had ever done had just
disappeared.&nbsp; I had become an un-person.&nbsp; And I had written a
lot.&nbsp; I started a journal, novel when I was 5, written teenage
angst poetry about my solvent abuse experiences, fairy stories for my
daughter I gave birth to when I was 16, letters published in CND
magazines in the early 80s, songs dedicated to Krishna, diaries that I
kept when I was in a psychiatric&nbsp;hospital when I was 18-19.&nbsp;
For the last 14 years, I've written for the sake of sanity.&nbsp;
'LOLLY AND THE PATH OF POPPIES' was written with a view to helping my
mum to come to terms with the drug addiction&nbsp;of my now dead little
sister.&nbsp; Comedy monologues have often come from things that I find
slightly frightening or sinister.<br>
      <br>
I very rarely go out to write 'a piece of writing' now; it just all
spews out into volumes of A4 spiral-bound notebooks.&nbsp; I write for
myself primarily or for whoever might pick it up, when I'm no longer in
the room, and take an interest.<br>
      <br>
The last 14 years have not been easy.&nbsp; My children have all had
difficult teens, my soul-mate has turned out to be the most eccentric
person I have ever met and I have been diagnosed as having a bipolar
condition that many people seem to believe&nbsp;I could control&nbsp;if
I wanted to - which is like demanding a diabetes sufferer to start
producing insulin and start eating sugar like a man.<br>
      <br>
My writing contains my extremes, helps me remember that no matter how
low I go, life comes around again to be vibrant and healthy and happy.<br>
