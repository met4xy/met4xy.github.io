Porter is a pseudonym for Skylan Mo is an antonym for Patrick
Porter.&nbsp; Born in the backalley of a crackerbox in Schenectady NY
as the 55 bus chivvied the slush.&nbsp; Leafy brittle neon on cracked
panes let the White Owl out.&nbsp; Henry suffered financial reverses,
grew ill, and finally died in 1913.&nbsp; Enrolled in a Catholic
elementary school and was treated accordingly.&nbsp; Father drove drunk
over railroad tracks in Murfreesboro TN and the muffler was amputated
from the flank.&nbsp; Tall weeds in traileryard, Porter cried and was
scared of sunflowers.&nbsp; His first memory is of a K-Mart sign in
Huntsville AL.&nbsp; He removed&nbsp;a wad of gum&nbsp;from his mouth,
ran it over with a dirtbike tire, and placed&nbsp;the wad&nbsp;into his
mouth a-fresh.&nbsp; Mountains are cold&nbsp;and drip with lonely old
mailbox roads.&nbsp; Here&nbsp;Porter pulled his pubes, pounded his
head on a punkrock and befriended many Beavis &amp; Buttheads.&nbsp; A
tiny nitelight out in the distance, in the woods, in a miner's town
where teenagers go and drink pints in cold old shafts (signs with
skulls &amp; crossbones on em).&nbsp; Then adulthood &amp; etc
etc.&nbsp; Currently Mr. Porter cum MO is 87 years old and hobbles
around X-mas parades&nbsp;gumming his cane and waiting in line to buy
hot choco.&nbsp; He has written a million pounds of poetry and two
novels and 5 record indie albums (sans indie smarm glasses) of John
Denver hilarious sincerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;has also wrecked two
cars, consumed 583 hot pockets,&nbsp;popped pimples&nbsp;in the
mirrors&nbsp;of&nbsp;56 greyhound buses,&nbsp;engaged in 67 failed
marriages and has gnawed the end of 87 tethers.&nbsp; His big bad blah
boring&nbsp;BAH. He has sung women in three cities. <br><br>Electronic enclave is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/patrickportermusic" target="_blank">www.myspace.com/patrickportermusic</a>.&nbsp;
Here there is stuff, who knows, there are things, of him,&nbsp;that he
didn't put there, such as paintings, songs, words, turds, shards,
gargles, old toothbrushes.&nbsp; Selah-de-dah.<br><br><br><img style="width: 500px; height: 533px;" alt="Flowers 16" src="../images/PatrickPorter_flowers16_ORIG.gif"><br></span><br><br><br><span class="text_white_bold">Click below for Patrick's work</span><br><br><span class="text_white"><a target="_blank" href="../documents/PatrickPorter-Pomes.pdf">Pomes </a>(.pdf)</span><br class="text_white"><span class="text_white"></span><br><br class="text_white">
