              playwright, poet, novelist, actor, director, artist,
              musician, and teacher as a way to promote the work of a

              starting their public journey as writers and artists, they
              believe in taking risks, breaking down walls, and sharing
              their view of the world with integrity, personality,
              vision, and a clear and distinct Voice.</span><span

              a New Mystic?</span><br class="text_white">
            <span class="text_white">The idea of the New Mystic
              developed from Joey's experiments with poetry, meditation,
              drum journeying, mantra, and conscious dreaming at the
              turn of the new millennium. During intensive study and
              substantial research into history, philosophy, spiritual
              systems, shamanism, mythology, quantum physics, folklore,
              and esoteric, Gnostic and hermetical texts, Joey began to
              apply a catalogue of symbols to his daily lived
              experiences and out of this work came dozens of published
              poems and eventually an e-book entitled <span
                style="font-style: italic;">New Mystic Alchemy</span>.<br>
              <br>
              A New Mystic is a Seeker; a believer that all things are
              connected and there is much to be mined from the
              overlapping metaphors (to use a favorite word of Joseph
              Campbell) and stories in all of the many branches of
              higher thought mentioned above. The New Mystic is a walker
              between the worlds—shaman, actor, artist, writer,
              philosopher, quantum physicist—one who knows the coin has
              no sides; the Zoroastrian duality is a veil of maya (an
              illusion), and that Anything is Possible.<br>
              <br>
              The New Mystic is ultramodern and tied to the Ways of the
              Ancients—a synthesizer of Renaissance ideals and the New
              Technic of cyber-communication.</span><br>
