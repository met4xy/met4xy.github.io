                My Friend and Mentor “Ro”: A Tribute to Rosemary Ellen
                Guiley (1950–2019)</span> <br>
              <br>
              Of all the losses we are destined to suffer in the course
              of a lifetime, I find the loss of a mentor to be one of
              the hardest. <br>
              <br>
              It was ten years ago this November that I first met
              Rosemary (whom I affectionately came to call Ro a few
              years into our multilayered relationship). A few months
              before, during a trip to Point Pleasant, WV to see the
              Mothman Museum with Tonya, we were driving back from the
              McClintock Wildlife Refuge (the TNT Area in local
              parlance) when we saw an interdimensional being.<br>
              <br>
              Word quickly spread and Ro was one of a handful of
              investigators who met with us to recreate the
              circumstances of our experience and visit the site where
              the interdimensional appeared and disappeared.<br>
              <br>
              That weekend was the start of a friendship, a mentorship,
              and eventually a relationship as writer and publisher. <br>
              <br>
              The paranormal field is one that is met with endless
              cynicism. It attracts a lot of different personalities and
              the methods and authenticity of some of the investigators
              and even experiencers span a wide range, with the far end
              being outright fraud. There is also a lot of
              back-stabbing, trash-talking, and unproductive competition
              (read one-upmanship). Ro and I agreed that the TV “reality
              show” culture has not helped to legitimize the field and
              has created a vast number of misperceptions about a very
              important aspect of our experiences on Earth and what
              comes after.<br>
              <br>
              But Ro was on the opposite end of that spectrum. She was
              professional beyond a doubt. Her methods that first
              weekend in Point Pleasant made a lasting impression on me.
              At the time, Tonya and I had no idea that, ten years
              later, we would be doing the same work as Ro was doing as
              often as we are, and have two books published about our
              work, with more on the way.<br>
              <br>
              And it is all thanks to Ro. Her belief in us has been the
              driving force behind all that we have accomplished—and
              hope to continue to—in the field of paranormal research.<br>
              <br>
              Ro was many things. First, she was an experiencer, which
              made her compassionate toward those she interviewed. She
              was a detail-oriented investigator, with a healthy balance
              of skepticism and deep belief. She was also a gifted
              writer, with over 60 titles to her credit—many of which
              are standards in the field. I have read about a quarter of
              them and have reviewed about ten. Tonya and I were honored
              to have our stories told in about a half dozen of them.
              So, when she asked Tonya to write <i>Living the Intuitive
                Life: Cultivating Extraordinary Awareness</i> in 2016
              and asked us to write <i>Watch Out for the Hallway: Our
                Two Year Investigation of the Most Haunted Library in
                North Carolina</i> a year later for her imprint,
              Visionary Living Publishing, we were beyond honored—we
              were determined to apply all she had taught us to
              contribute in substantial ways to the field to which she
              had devoted her life.<br>
              <br>
              Ro was also our friend, helping us through some tough
              times as a family and helping both Tonya and Jolie, our
              soon to be 20-year-old daughter—both of whom are gifted
              psychic mediums—to understand, develop, and apply their
              talents safely and to help others. She spent many nights
              at our “holler” home in West Virginia as both a friend and
              as an investigator and lectured on fairies and dreams at
              our New Mystics Center for Arts and Education. I have fond
              memories of our adventures, shared paranormal experiences,
              and of hearing her typing away in our guest bedroom,
              answering emails and writing her books.<br>
              <br>
              Although she was often on the TV and radio, she was down
              to Earth and accessible—using these media to foster
              interest in the legitimacy of the paranormal and to share
              her theories and research with a broad audience. It was
              never about ego. Never about being a star.<br>
              <br>
              Although, in many ways, she was. <br>
              <br>
              <img src="images/joeyropic2.jpg" alt="Rosemary Ellen
                Guiley" width="450" height="338"><br>
              <br>
              Ro was the center of an informal band of investigators she
              dubbed The Mothman Irregulars, of which I am honored to be
              a founding member. A few other founding members—Steve Ward
              and John and Tim Frick—were there that first time in
              November. We mourn her loss together and carry on her
              work, which we experienced for many, many hours during our
              shared field investigations and roundtable chats at diners
              and in hotel lobbies until the early hours of the morning.
              At her request, Steve and I are now coauthoring a book, to
              be published mid-2020 by Visionary Living, which will
              carry on through her husband, Joe. Her example and
              guidance are weaved throughout its examination of the
              patterns and parallels of the phenomena we have all
              devoted so much time and energy to trying to understand.<br>
              <br>
              Ro’s spirit and guidance are as powerful now as before she
              transitioned. Tonya and I have received many messages from
              her in a variety of ways (dreams, automatic writing, and
              even brief visits right before and after her passing) and
              we have heard from numerous colleagues who have reported
              the same. <br>
              <br>
              It is a comfort to know that we have not truly lost our
              friend and mentor—that she is watching over and guiding us
              even as she collects firsthand data and experiences of the
              phenomena that she devoted her life to studying and
              reported about.<br>
              <br>
              As she recently shared with Tonya through automatic
              writing: <i>Bigfoot is real!</i><br>
              <br>
              Just what that means… well, we’ll have to wait and see for
              ourselves.<br>
              <br>
              We have been invited to speak about Ro by different
              organizations in recent weeks, and it is an honor to do
              so. This brief Tribute is just one way to express our
              gratitude to all she gave to us, and shared with us—in the
              field, in our home, and at events like the annual Mothman
              Festival—in the almost ten full years that we were lucky
              enough to know her on this fleeting plane of existence.<br>
